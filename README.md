##Motivation

The electric vehicle (EV) market in India is undergoing rapid transformation due to increasing environmental awareness, government initiatives like the FAME scheme, and advancements in EV technology. The need to understand market segments is crucial for strategizing EV adoption and infrastructure development.

##Introduction

This project explores three segmentation approaches for the Indian EV market:
Production-Based Segmentation: Categorizes EVs into two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, and e-buses.
Consumer-Based Segmentation: Identifies clusters based on consumer demographics and preferences using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
Geographical Segmentation: Analyzes regional differences based on charging infrastructure and government policies using hierarchical clustering.

##Methodology

- Production-Based Segmentation: Used K-means clustering with Elbow method, identifying 3 clusters optimized for vehicle types.
- Consumer-Based Segmentation: Applied GMM for flexible clustering based on consumer preferences, achieving a silhouette score of 0.91.
- Geographical Segmentation: Employed hierarchical clustering to segment states based on charging infrastructure and policy effectiveness.

- Maharashtra and Delhi emerge as potential markets for four-wheelers and charging infrastructure.
- Consumer insights reveal affordability and preference for SUVs and sedans, with a budget under â‚¹15 lakh.
- States like Maharashtra, Telangana, and Karnataka exhibit high EV adoption readiness, whereas North Eastern states and others show limited infrastructure and policy support.

###These findings guide market entry strategies and infrastructure expansion for EV stakeholders
